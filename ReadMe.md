[D4pi](https://d4pi.com/) lets you show/share Diablo 4 items as
text/links -- as an alternative to screenshots --
[see a demo](https://d4pi.com/view/#0.2.0.0%26%0AMasked%20Work%0A2%0As%0Ar%0Ah%0A12%0A281%20ip%0A%3D%0A351%20Armor%0A%3D%0A%2B3.3%25%20CSC%0A%2B18%20i%0AWIYPAG%2025%25%20MSf2S%0A%3D%0A5CSD%0A10LRwNDR%0A2.5ta%0A%3D%0ARL%2017%0AS%0A)

D4pi supports various formats, abbreviations, and acronyms.  For
example, all of the following entries are recognized and rendered as
`+2.5% Critical Strike Chance`:

* `+2.5% CSC`
* `2.5% CSC`
* `2.5 CSC`
* `2.5csc`

The `+`, `%`, and space characters are all optional; and the
abbreviations and acronyms are case-insensitive --
